        <p> This page is dedicated to my most used social media platforms.</p>

        <p> I would put my social media links here, but I am not comfortable sharing them at this time. However, I do have a few platforms that I use regularly:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Twitter --  I usually use this platform to find funny memes or news about sports in general. This expands from college to professional sports. I also use this platform to promote my ideas and projects.</li>
            <li>LinkedIn --  This platform is my main professional profile. The platform helps me connect with other professionals and some friends that I make throughout my career. From my serving days in the US Navy to college and my current postion as an Intern. Also this platforms is my most favorite job searching social.</li>
            <li>GitHub --  The main purpose for Github is to find ideas or even tutorials that are free on open repos. Also this stores most of my projects even some that I have not published which can be set on private. Most of the time I spend my time here also looking for job posting via a users program. </li>
