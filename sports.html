        <p>Welcome to the Sports page! Here you can find information about my favorite sports, teams, and athletes. Whether you're a fan of football, basketball, soccer, or any other sport, there's something here for everyone.</p>
        <p>Feel free to explore the links in the navigation menu to learn more about me and my interests in sports.</p>

        <p> One of the main sports I watch usually every weekend is MMA in particular the UFC. This sport has taken the world by storm, the UFC represents worldwide fighters. I recently saw my first live fight at UFC Louisville in the YUM Center. Although it was just a fight night, Louisivlle broke the record for highest-grossing single day sportting event at the YUM and in the UFC. I suspect that the UFC will be back with a Pay-Per View event soon. </p>

        <p> Another sport I am quite acquainted with is basketball. I grew up watching and playing basketball since I was a kid. My favorite NBA team that I follow is the Los Angeles Lakers. The main reason was because of the late Kobe Bryant. All of my jerseys I own are Kobe Bryant's jersey from different years and colorways. </p>
