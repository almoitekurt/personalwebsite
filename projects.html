        <p> A couple of projects that I've worked on as an independent devloper include a chatbot utilizing the OpenAI API. I built this project in Python. It was a simple chatbot and acts the same way as CHATPT.</p>
        <p> The chatbot however is outdated and uses the version 3.5 Turbo. It can be updated by changing few lines to reference the newest versions such as 4O or even 4.5.</p>

        <p> One of my most recent projects would be a Python DNS Network sniffer. The goal of this project was to gain experience an learn a little bit more about cybersecurity. This program utilizes many libraries to include the main library called Scapy. </p>
        <p> Scapy is a powerful Python library used for network packet manipulation and analysis. It allows users to create, send, and capture network packets, making it an essential tool for network security and analysis tasks.</p>

        <p>Lastly, this whole website for this Web Devlopment class will be published as one of my projects. I took the opportunity to make my own website so that I can showcase my skills in other programming languages.</p>

        <p> These projects can also be found on my personal Github profile. </p>
